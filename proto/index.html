        <p><strong>What is a Credit Card?</strong><br> A credit card is a plastic or metal card that allows you to access a line of credit offered by the bank that issued the card. Every time you pay for something with a credit card, you're borrowing money from the card issuer to cover the purchase. You then have to pay that money back, either in full at the end of the month or over time.<br><br>
          <strong>Why get a Credit Card?</strong><br>Build credit: Establishing a good payment history can help you prove your creditworthiness, allowing you to borrow money in the future at lower rates. <br>
          Flexibility: Though it's best to always pay your balance in full each month, a credit card allows you to pay for things over time, which helps when you have a major purchase or handle a financial emergency.</p>
          <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Here are concepts associated with cardit cards to keep in mind</strong></p>
          <p><u>Credit limit:</u> When you’re approved for a credit card, the bank authorizes a credit limit, which is the maximum amount you can borrow.<br>
          <u>Interest rates:</u> Credit Card interest rates tell you the cost to owning a credit card company money from month to month. The interest rate is referred to as APR (annual percentage rate). On average Interest rates range from 15% to 18%.<br>
          <u>Payments:</u>You will receive a bill on a monthly basis. You have the option of paying a certain minimum amount, paying the whole balance in full, or paying some amount in between. <strong>WARNING:</strong> Paying just the minimum every month is ultimately the most expensive option, since it will cost you the most in interest. Paying in full is the best option because it allows you to avoid paying any interest on purchases. If you do not make the minimum payment you will be charged a late feel, and your credit score may be affected.

  Spending time with friends can be fun, but it can also be costly.
  Because of your big purchase, you overdraw on your account. Instead of it denying your purchase,
  you’re able to get your meal because you have overdraft protection. Sadly, there’s (of course) a fee...
  maybe ramen is in the cards for tomorrow?

  <p><strong> Congratulations on completing the Financial Literacy Experience!! We hope you were able to learn some information which you can apply to your upcoming life decisions. Below there is an overview of topics mentioned on our website as well as links to more resources. Please, feel free to play again and try out all the decisions.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Budgeting</strong></p>
  <p>A budget is nothing more than a spending plan. Budgeting is so important because it allows you to achieve your personal and financial goals. You become more aware of where your money goes on a weekly or monthly basis. Whether you are saving for a car, a home, a trip, or retirement budgeting significantly increase your chances of success. Setting aside some of your money each paycheck can open an entire world of possibilities. Your late teens and twenties are the best times to do the things you want to do. With a spending plan, you’d be surprised at how much you can squeeze out of your income. We recommend using free budgeting apps like Mint or PocketGuard to help you manage your wallet.

  <p><strong>Credit</strong></p>
  <p>Credit is such an important topic that is never discussed until things get bad. Credit is at the center of your financial power! It helps you get the things you will likely need such as a car loan or a mortgage. It is much easier to establish good credit and keep it there than it is to raise a low credit score. Good credit saves you money and opens many opportunities for you. It allows you to receive larger loans with lower interest rates. This can be the difference between whether you can start your own business or buy your first home.</p>

  <p>Spending time with friends can be fun, but it can also be costly. You end up overdrafting from your checking account. Instead of it denying your purchase, you’re able to get your meal because you have overdraft protection. Sadly, there’s (of course) a fee...maybe you’ll check your balance before you go out next time?

        <p><strong>What is a Credit Card?</strong><br> A credit card is a plastic or metal card that allows you to access a line of credit offered by the bank that issued the card. Every time you pay for something with a credit card, you're borrowing money from the card issuer to cover the purchase. You then have to pay that money back, either in full at the end of the month or over time.<br><br>
          <strong>Why get a Credit Card?</strong><br>Build credit: Establishing a good payment history can help you prove your creditworthiness, allowing you to borrow money in the future at lower rates. <br>
          Flexibility: Though it's best to always pay your balance in full each month, a credit card allows you to pay for things over time, which helps when you have a major purchase or handle a financial emergency.</p>
          <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Here are concepts associated with cardit cards to keep in mind</strong></p>
          <p><u>Credit limit:</u> When you’re approved for a credit card, the bank authorizes a credit limit, which is the maximum amount you can borrow.<br>
          <u>Interest rates:</u> Credit Card interest rates tell you the cost to owning a credit card company money from month to month. The interest rate is referred to as APR (annual percentage rate). On average Interest rates range from 15% to 18%.<br>
          <u>Payments:</u>You will receive a bill on a monthly basis. You have the option of paying a certain minimum amount, paying the whole balance in full, or paying some amount in between. <strong>WARNING:</strong> Paying just the minimum every month is ultimately the most expensive option, since it will cost you the most in interest. Paying in full is the best option because it allows you to avoid paying any interest on purchases. If you do not make the minimum payment you will be charged a late feel, and your credit score may be affected.
